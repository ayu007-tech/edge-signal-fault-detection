Industrial machines generate continuous sensor signals such as temperature and vibration.
These signals are affected by noise, drift, and communication delay.
Delayed fault detection can cause equipment damage.

This project designs an edge-based industrial signal monitoring and fault detection system
that processes signals locally using signal conditioning, filtering, and threshold-based logic.
